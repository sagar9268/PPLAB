Aayi Diwali,

Boom Boom!

Deep jalalo,

Ding ding!

Door karo Andhiyara

Ting Ting.

Diwali is my favorite festival,

but I donâ€™t like testicle.

Spread the love and light,

by having some pillow fights.

Diwali is the festival of beauty,

as a diya was lit by Shilpa Shetty.

On Diwali we eat sweets and play cards,

while the whole time every one farts.

Aayi Diwali,

Boom Boom!

Deep jala lo,

Ting Ting!

Door karo andhiyara,

Ding Ding.

I will add more if I think of something nice.
